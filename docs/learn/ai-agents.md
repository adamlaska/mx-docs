## **llms.txt**

MultiversX publishes an `llms.txt` file that supplies context enabling LLMs to effectively reference the full MultiversX documentation during inference.
https://docs.multiversx.com/llms.txt

## **Skills**

We have a GitHub repository that provides a structured collection of specialized "Skills", "Global Workflows" (Roles), and "Documentation" designed to equip AI agents with the deep technical knowledge required to build, audit, and optimize on MultiversX.
